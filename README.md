‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è A few remarks

Data was scraped from https://rt.pornhub.com/pornstars and https://rt.pornhub.com/pornstars/top?si=1. Photos taken from https://www.iafd.com/

The python code of the scraping process is in *pornhub_data_collection.ipynd*. It is not used in the running process, just for demonstration purposes of how to collect the database.

You are free to add new photos to your photo database - *main_run.py* extract vectors for the new photos in the directory before analyzing your input image. Extraction vectors from new photos take some time but the information is being saved in the database and then reuse so it will take much less time.
